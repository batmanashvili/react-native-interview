1. What are WebSockets and what are the alternatives?

WebSocket is a communication protocol that provides a full-duplex, persistent connection between a client (such as a web browser) and a server over a single TCP connection. 
Unlike HTTP, which is request-response based and typically requires the client to initiate every interaction, 
WebSocket allows both the client and server to send messages to each other at any time, enabling real-time, low-latency communication.


This is particularly useful for applications that require instant data updates, 
such as chat applications, online gaming, live sports updates, and collaborative tools.

Alternatives to WebSockets include:
* HTTP Long Polling: The client repeatedly requests updates from the server. 
    This simulates real-time communication but is less efficient and introduces more latency compared to WebSockets.
* Server-Sent Events (SSE): Allows servers to push updates to the client over a single HTTP connection, 
    but it is one-way (server-to-client only).
* WebRTC: Primarily designed for peer-to-peer communication (audio, video, and data), 
    often used in video conferencing apps like Zoom. It is more complex and suited for direct client-to-client communication rather than client-server.
* WebTransport: A newer protocol that enables low-latency, bidirectional communication over HTTP/3. 
    It is designed to be a modern alternative to WebSockets and is still being adopted.

Key differences:
With HTTP, the client must always initiate communication to receive new data.
With WebSocket, after the initial handshake, either the client or server can send messages at any time.
WebSocket is bidirectional and persistent, while alternatives like SSE are one-way, and long polling is less efficient.

2. What is the difference between HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and HTTPS?

HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol. HTTP/1.1, introduced in 1997, is a protocol for transferring data between a client (such as a browser) and a server. 
It uses a request-response model, where the client sends a request and waits for the server's response. 
HTTP/1.1 introduced persistent connections, allowing multiple requests and responses over the same TCP connection, but requests are still processed sequentially, which can cause delays (head-of-line blocking). 
Features like chunked transfer encoding and pipelining were added, but pipelining is rarely used in practice.

HTTP/2 is a major revision designed to improve performance and efficiency.
It uses a single, persistent TCP connection to multiplex multiple requests and responses simultaneously (multiplexing), reducing latency. 
Data is split into small packets called frames, which can be interleaved and prioritized. 
HTTP/2 also compresses headers to reduce overhead. This allows resources (like CSS, JS, images) to be loaded in parallel, improving page load times.

HTTPS stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure. 
It is HTTP (any version) layered over SSL/TLS, providing encryption, data integrity, and authentication. 
HTTPS ensures that data exchanged between client and server is encrypted and cannot be easily intercepted or tampered with. 
The security is established through SSL/TLS handshakes and digital certificates, which verify the server's identity.

HTTP/3 is the latest version, built on top of QUIC (a protocol over UDP). 
It further reduces latency and improves performance, especially in unreliable network conditions, 
by eliminating head-of-line blocking at the transport layer and providing faster connection establishment.
